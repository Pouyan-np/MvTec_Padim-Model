"# MvTec_Padim-Model" 
Project Report: Anomaly Detection in MVTec Dataset
Introduction
The objective of this project is to perform anomaly detection using the MVTec Dataset, utilizing the PADIM (Pixel-wise Anomaly Detection with Image Masks) model. The dataset comprises various categories such as bottles, cables, capsules, carpets, hazelnuts, metal nuts, and pills. For each category, the goal is to detect anomalies in images using segmentation techniques.

Methodology
Dataset Preparation:

The MVTec dataset is structured into different categories, each containing images with various types of anomalies (e.g., scratches, cracks, threads).
Model Selection:

PADIM, a pixel-wise anomaly detection model, is selected for its effectiveness in segmenting anomalies from the background in images.
Training and Evaluation:

Data Loading: Each category is loaded using the MVTec class from the anomalib.data module, configured for segmentation tasks.
Model Training: The PADIM model is trained for each category using the Engine class from anomalib.engine.
Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as pixel_AUROC, pixel_F1Score, image_AUROC, and image_F1Score to assess its effectiveness in anomaly detection.
Ranking Results:

Results are ranked based on three key metrics:
pixel_F1Score: Measures the accuracy of anomaly detection at the pixel level.
image_AUROC: Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish anomalies from normal images.
image_F1Score: Provides an overall measure of anomaly detection performance at the image level.

Conclusion
The PADIM model demonstrates varying performance across different categories of the MVTec dataset. Overall, it achieves the highest anomaly detection accuracy in the MvTec category based on multiple evaluation metrics. Further optimization and fine-tuning of the model parameters could potentially enhance performance in lower-ranking categories such as hazelnut and cable.

Future Work
